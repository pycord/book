# Community
The `pycord.community` module is very similar to the design of the prior versions' `discord.ext` module
except for it having a much different design and different set of modules.

## What is the criteria?
The `pycord.community` module is meant to host a abundance of libraries, although our criteria is pretty strict:

- Has to be 100% Type-safe
- Has to have no **required** extra dependencies
- Needs to be used by more then 30 Repositories, or by core developers
- Has to have a respective use
- Cannot be bloated
- Has to be written in Python (Although, expect some exceptions)

## What libraries are gonna be hosted
Libraries that will be included are quite obviously wanted modules, in example:

- Extensions (Cog replacement)
- Prefix (ext.commands replacement)
- Taskineer (ext.tasks replacement)
